This library works by storing the "clipboard" data by hiding it in an image and saving that image in the MediaLibrary on the device.

IMPORTANT - It's not possible to programmatically delete files from the MediaLibrary!
This means that continued use of this library will add more and more seemingly identical looking images in their "saved pictures" folder.

It is highly recommended that you warn your users about this behaviour and give them the ability to disable it.

Use the ProxyClipboard object where possible (see demo app for an example) to minimize access to the MediaLibrary.

This library used the Clipboard API in the full version of the .net framework (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/25w5tzxb.aspx) as a guideline.
